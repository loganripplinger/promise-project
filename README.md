# Challenge

## Requirements

## Features
All was written from scratch.
React frontend
Nodejs RESTful API
Singleton object model in Nodejs

## Note
Object model is not feature complete and is full of security holes. This is a prototype that was developed as fast as possible.

REST Controller will validate a given object's keys, but will not check the value's type

## Install
```
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```
